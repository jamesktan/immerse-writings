/*title*/The Enuma Elish
The Seven Tablets of Creation

by Leonard William King
(1902)

[The Enuma Elish is the earliest written creation myth, in which the God Marduk battles the chaos Goddess Tiamat and her evil minions. The name 'Enuma Elish' is derived from the first two words of the myth, meaning 'When in the Height'. Tiamat takes the form of a gigantic snake, and Marduk battles and defeats her using an arsenal of super-weapons. After his victory Marduk is made the leader of the Gods by acclamation. Marduk divides Tiamat's corpse into two portions, the upper half becoming the sky and the lower half, the earth. Marduk then creates humanity from his blood and bone.]


/*chapter*/Tablet I
1. When in the height heaven was not named,
2. And the earth beneath did not yet bear a name,
3. And the primeval Apsû, who begat them,
4. And chaos, Tiamat, the mother of them both,—
5. Their waters were mingled together,
6. And no field was formed, no marsh was to be seen;
7. When of the gods none had been called into being,
8. And none bore a name, and no destinies [were ordained];
9. Then were created the gods in the midst of [heaven],
10. Lahmu and Lahamu were called into being [...].
11. Ages increased, [...],
12. Then Anshar and Kishar were created, and over them [...].
13. Long were the days, then there came forth [...]
14. Anu, their son, [...]
15. Anshar and Anu [...]
16. And the god Anu [...]
17. Nudimmud, whom his fathers [his] begetters [...]
18. Abounding in all wisdom, [...]
19. He was exceeding strong [...]
20. He had no rival [...]
21. Thus. were established and [were ... the great gods ?.].
22 . But T[iamat and Âpsû] were still. in confusion [...],
23. They were troubled and [...]
24. In disorder?. ... [...]
26. And Tiamat roared [...]
25. Apsû was not diminished in might [...]
27. She smote, and their deeds [...]
28. Their way was evil ... [...] ...
29. Then Apsû, the begetter of the great gods,
30. Cried unto Mummu, his minister, and said unto him:
31. "O Mummu, thou minister that rejoicest my spirit,
32. "Come, unto Tiamat let us [go]!"
33. So they went and before Tiamat they lay down,
34. They consulted on a plan with regard to the gods [their sons].
35. Apsû opened his mouth [and spake],
36. And unto Tiamat, the glistening one, he addressed [the word]:
37. "[...] their way [...],
38. "By day I cannot rest, by night [I cannot lie down in peace.].
39. "But I will destroy their way, I will [...],
40. "Let there be lamentation, and let us lie down again in peace.."
41. When Tiamat [heard] these words,
42. She raged and cried aloud [...].
43. [She ...] grievously [...],
44. She uttered a curse, and unto [Apsû she spake]:
45. "What then shall we [do]?
46. "Let their way be made difficult, and let us [lie down again. in peace]."
47. Mummu answered, and gave counsel unto Apsû,
48. [...] and hostile to the gods. was the counsel Mu[mmu gave]:
49. "Come, their way is strong, but thou shalt destroy [it];
50. "Then by day shalt thou have rest, by night shalt thou lie down in peace.."
51. Apsû [hearkened unto] him and his countenance grew bright,
52. [Since] he i.e. Mummu. planned evil against the gods his sons.
53. [...] he was afraid [...],
54. His knees [became weak?.], they gave way beneath him,
55. [Because of the evil] which their first-born had planned.
56. [...] their [...] they altered?..
58. Lamentation [...] they sat in [sorrow] '
57. [...] they [...],
59. [...]
60. Then Ea, who knoweth all that [is], went up and he beheld their muttering.
61. [...]
62. [...] ... his pure incantation
63. [...] ... [...]
64. [...]
65. [...] misery
66. [...]
67. [...]
[Lines 68-82 are wanting.]
83. [...]
84 [...] ...
85. [...] the god Anu,
86. [... an aven]ger.
87. [...]
88. [...] and he shall confound Tiamat.
89. [...] he ...
90. [...] for ever.
91. [...] the evil,
92. [...] ... he spake:
93. "[...] thy [...] he hath conquered and
94. " [...] he [weepeth] and sitteth in tribulation?..
95. "[...] of fear,
96. "[...] we shall not lie down in peace..
97. "[...] Apsû is laid waste?.,
98. "[...] and Mummu, who were taken captive, in [...]
99. "[...] thou didst, ...
100. "[...] let us lie down in peace..
101. "[...] ... they will smite ?. [...].
102. " [...] let us lie down in peace..
103. "[...] thou shalt take vengeance for them,
104. "[...]unto the tempest shalt thou [...]!"
105. [And Tiamat hearkened unto] the word of the bright god, and said.:
106. "[...] shalt thou entrust! let us wage [war]!"
107. [...] the gods in the midst of [...]
108. [...] for the gods did she create.'
109. [They banded themselves together and] at the side of Tiamat [they] advanced;
110. [They were furious, they devised mischief without resting] night and [day].
111. [They prepared for battle], fuming and raging;
112. [They joined their forces] and made war.
113. [Ummu-Hubu]r, who formed all things,
114. [Made in addition] weapons invincible, she spawned monster-serpents,
115. [Sharp of] tooth, and merciless of fang;
116. [With poison instead of] blood she filled [their] bodies.
117. Fierce [monster-vipers] she clothed with terror,
118. [With splendour] she decked them, [she made them] of lofty stature.
119. [Whoever beheld] them, terror overcame him,
120. Their bodies reared up and none could withstand [their attack].
121. [She set] up vipers, and dragons, and the monster. [Lahamu],
122. [And hurricanes], and raging hounds, and scorpion-men,
123. And mighty [tempests], and fish-men, and[rams];
124. [They bore] cruel weapons, without fear of [the fight].
125. Her commands [were mighty], [none] could resist them;
126. After this fashion, huge of stature, [she made] eleven monsters..
127. Among the gods who were her sons, inasmuch as he had given [her support],
128. She exalted Kingu; in their midst [she raised] him [to power].
129. To march before the forces, to lead [the host],
130. To give the battle-signal, to advance to the attack,
131. To direct the battle, to control the fight,
132. Unto him she entrusted; in [costly raiment] she made him sit, saying.:
133. "I have uttered thy spell, in the assembly of the gods I have raised thee to power.
134. "The dominion over all the gods [have I entrusted unto him].
135. "Be thou exalted, thou my chosen spouse,
136. "May they magnify thy name over all [of them ... the Anunnaki]."
137. She gave him the Tablets of Destiny, on [his] breast she laid them, saying.:
138. "Thy command shall not be without avail, and[the word of thy mouth shall be established]."
139. Now Kingu, thus. exalted, having received [the power of Anu],
140. [Decreed] the fate among the gods his sons, saying.:
141. "Let the opening of your mouth [quench] the Fire-god;
142. "Whoso is exalted in the battle, let him [display his. might]!"


/*chapter*/Tablet II
1. Tiamat made weighty her handiwork,
2. [Evil] she wrought against the gods her children.
3. [To avenge] Apsû, Tiamat planned evil,
4. But how she had collected her [forces, the god ...] unto Ea divulged.
5. Ea [hearkened to] this thing, and
6. He was [grievous]ly afflicted and he sat in sorrow.
7. [The days] went by, and his anger was appeased,
8. And to [the place of] Anshar his father he took[his way].
9. [He went] and standing before Anshar, the father who begat him,
10. [All that] Tiamat had plotted he repeated unto him,
11. [Saying, "Ti]amat our mother hath conceived a hatred for us,
12. "With all her force she rageth, full of wrath.
13. "All the gods have turned to her,
14. "[With] those, whom ye created, they go at her side.
15. "They are banded together and at the side of Tiamat they advance;
16. "They are furious, they devise mischief without resting night and day.
17. "They prepare for battle, fuming and raging;
18. "They have joined their forces and are making war.
19. "Ummu-Hubur, who formed all things,
20. "Hath made in addition weapons invincible, she hath spawned monster-serpents,
21. "Sharp of tooth, and merciless of fang.
22. "With poison instead of blood she hath filled their bodies.
23. "Fierce monster-vipers she hath clothed with terror,
24. "With splendour she hath decked them, she hath made them of lofty stature.
25. "Whoever beholdeth them is overcome by terror,"
26. "Their bodies rear up and none can withstand their attack.
27. "She hath set up vipers, and dragons, and the
28. "And hurricanes and raging hounds, and scorpion-men,
29. "And mighty tempests, and fish-men and rams;
30. "They bear cruel weapons, without fear of the fight.
31. "Her commands are mighty, none can resist them;
32. "After this fashion, huge of stature, hath she made eleven monsters..
33. "Among the gods who are her sons, inasmuch as he hath given her support,
34. She hath exalted Kingu; in their midst she hath raised him to power.
35. "To march before the forces, to lead the host,

38. "Unto him [hath she entrusted]; in costly raiment she hath made him sit, saying.:
39. "'[I have uttered] thy [spell], in the assembly of the gods I have raised thee to power,
40. "'[The dominion over all] the gods have I entrusted [unto thee].
41. "'[Be thou exalted], thou [my chosen spouse],
42. "'[May they magnify thy name over all of them ...] ...'
43. "[She hath given him the Tablets of Destiny, on his breast she] laid them, saying.:
44. "'[Thy command shall not be without avail], and the [word] of thy mouth shall be established.'
45. "[Now Kingu, thus. exalted], having received the power of Anu,
46. "Decreed the fate [for the gods, her sons], saying.:
47. "'Let [the opening of your mouth] quench the Fire-god;
48. "'[Whoso is exalted in the battle], let him display his. might!'"
49. [When Anshar heard how Tiamat] was mightily in revolt,
50. [...], he bit his lips,
51. [...], his mind was not at peace,
52. His [...], he made a bitter lamentation:
53. [...] battle,

[A gap of about ten lines occurs here.]
69. [...]
70. [...]
71. [...]
72. [Anshar unto] his son addressed [the word]:
73. "[...] ... my mighty hero,
74. "[Whose] strength [is great] and whose onslaught cannot be withstood,
75. "[Go] and stand before Tiamat,
76. "[That] her spirit [may be appeased], that her heart may be merciful.
77. "[But if] she will not hearken unto thy word,
78. "Our [word] shalt thou speak unto her, that she may be pacified."
79. [He heard the] word of his father Anshar
80. And [he directed] his path to her, towards her he took the way.
81. Anu [drew nigh], he beheld the muttering of Tiamat,
82. [But he could not withstand her], and he turned back.
83. [...] Anshar
84. [...] he spake unto him:
85. "[...] upon me

104. [...]
105. [...] an avenger [...]
106. [...] va[liant]
107. [...] in the place of his decision
108. [...] he spake unto him:
109. "[...] thy father
110. "Thou art my son, who maketh merciful his heart.
111. " [...] to the battle shalt thou draw nigh,
112. "[...] he that shall behold thee shall have peace."
113. And the lord rejoiced at the word of his father,
114. And he drew nigh and stood before Anshar.
115. Anshar beheld him and his heart was filled with joy,
116. He kissed him on the lips and his fear departed from him.
117. "[O my father], let not the word of thy lips be overcome,
118. "Let me go, that I may accomplish all that is in thy heart.
119.. "[O Anshar], let not the word of thy lips be overcome,
120. ". [Let me] go, that I may accomplish all that is in thy heart."
121. "What man is it, who hath brought thee forth to battle?
122. "[...] Tiamat, who is a woman, is armed and attacketh thee."
123. "[...] ... rejoice and be glad;

125. "[...] ... rejoice and be glad;
126. "[The neck] of Tiamat shalt thou swiftly trample under foot.
127. "O my [son], who knoweth all wisdom,
128. "Pacify [Tiama]t with thy pure incantation.
129. "Speedily set out upon thy way,
130. "For [thy blood ?.] shall not be poured out, thou shalt return again."
131. The lord rejoiced at the word of his father,
132. His heart exulted, and unto his father he spake:
133. "O Lord of the gods, Destiny of the great gods,
134. "If I, your avenger,
135. "Conquer Tiamat and give you life,
136. "Appoint an assembly, make my fate preeminent and proclaim it.
137. "In Upshukkinaku seat yourselves joyfully together,
138. "With my word in place of you will I decree fate.
139. "May whatsoever I do remain unaltered,
140. "May the word of my lips never be changed nor made of no avail."


/*chapter*/Tablet III
1. Anshar opened his mouth, and
2. [Unto Gaga], his [minister], spake the word:
3. "[O Gaga, thou minis]ter that rejoicest my spirit,
4. ''[Unto Lahmu and Lah]amu will I send thee.
5. "[...] thou canst attain,

/*chapter*/Tablet IV
1. They prepared for him a lordly chamber,
2 . Before his fathers as prince he took his place.
3. "Thou art chiefest among the great gods,
4. "Thy fate is unequalled, thy word is Anu!
5. "O Marduk, thou art chiefest among the great gods,
6. "Thy fate is unequalled, thy word is Anu!
7. "Henceforth not without avail shall be thy command,
8. "In thy power shall it be to exalt and to abase.
9. "Established shall be the word of thy mouth, irresistible shall be thy command;
10. "None among the gods shall transgress thy boundary.
11. "Abundance, the desire of the shrines of the gods,
12. "Shall be established in thy sanctuary, even though they lack (offerings).
13. "O Marduk, thou art our avenger!
14. "We give thee sovereignty over the whole world.
15. "Sit thou down in night, be exalted in thy command.
16. "Thy weapon shall never lose its power, it shall crush thy foe.
17. "O lord, spare the life of him that putteth his trust in thee,
18. "But as for the god who began the rebellion, pour out his life."
19. Then set they in their midst a garment,
20. And unto Marduk their first-born they spake:
21. "May thy fate, O lord, be supreme among the gods,
22. "To destroy and to create; speak thou the word, and (thy command) shall be fulfilled.
23. "Command now and let the garment vanish;
24. "And speak the word again and let the garment reappear!"
25. Then he spake with his mouth, and the garment vanished;
26. Again he commanded it, and the garment reappeared.
27. When the gods, his fathers, beheld (the fulfilment of) his word,
28. They rejoiced, and they did homage (unto him, saying), " Marduk is king! "
29. They bestowed upon him the sceptre, and the throne, and the ring,
30. They give him an invincible weapon, which overwhelmeth the foe.
31. "Go, and cut off the life of Tiamat,
32. "And let the wind carry her blood into secret places."
33. After the gods his fathers had decreed for the lord his fate,
34. They caused him to set out on a path of prosperity and success.
35 . He made ready the bow, he chose his weapon,
36. He slung a spear upon him and fastened it . . .
37. He raised the club, in his right hand he grasped (it),
38. The bow and the quiver he hung at his side.
39. He set the lightning in front of him,
40. With burning flame he filled his body.
41. He made a net to enclose the inward parts of Tiamat,
42. The four winds he stationed so that nothing of her might escape;
43. The South wind and the North wind and the East wind and the West wind
44. He brought near to the net, the gift of his father Anu.
45. He created the evil wind, and the tempest, and the hurricane,
46. And the fourfold wind, and the sevenfold wind, and the whirlwind, and the wind which had no equal;
47. He sent forth the winds which he had created, the seven of them;
48. T o disturb the inward parts of Tiamat, they followed after him.
49. Then the lord raised the thunderbolt, his mighty weapon,
50. He mounted the chariot, the storm unequalled for terror,
51. He harnessed and yoked unto it four horses,
52. Destructive, ferocious, overwhelming, and swift of pace;
53. [...] were their teeth, they were flecked with foam;
54. They were skilled in [...], they had been trained to trample underfoot.
55. [...], mighty in battle,
56. Left and [right ...
57. His garment was [...], he was clothed with terror,
58. With overpowering brightness his head was crowned.
59. Then he set out, he took his way,
60. And towards the [rag]ing Tiamat he set his face.
61. On his lips he held [...],
62. ... [...] he grasped in his hand.
63. Then they beheld him, the gods beheld him,
64. The gods his fathers beheld him, the gods beheld him.
65. And the lord drew nigh, he gazed upon the inward parts of Tiamat,
66. He perceived the muttering of Kingu, her spouse.
67. As (Marduk) gazed, (Kingu) was troubled in his gait,
68. His will was destroyed and his motions ceased.
69. And the gods, his helpers, who marched by his side,
70. Beheld their leader's [...], and their sight was troubled.
71. But Tiamat [...], she turned not her neck,
72. With lips that failed not she uttered rebellious words:
73. "[...] thy coming as lord of the gods,
74. "From their places have they gathered, in thy place are they!"
75. Then the lord [raised] the thunderbolt, his mighty weapon,
76. [And against] Tiamat, who was raging, thus he sent (the word):
77. "[Thou] art become great, thou hast exalted thyself on high,
78. "And thy [heart hath prompted] thee to call to battle.
79. "[...] their fathers [...],
80. "[...] their [...] thou hatest [...].
81. "[Thou hast exalted King]u to be [thy] spouse,
82. "[Thou hast . . . ] him, that, even as Anu, he should issue decrees.
83. "[...] thou hast followed after evil,
84. "And [against] the .gods my fathers thou hast contrived thy wicked plan.
85. "Let then thy host be equipped, let thy weapons be girded on!
86. "Stand! I and thou, let us join battle!"
87. When Tiamat heard these words,
88. She was like one possessed, she lost her reason.
89. Tiamat uttered wild, piercing cries,
90. She trembled and shook to her very foundations.
91. She recited an incantation, she pronounced her spell,
92. And the gods of the battle cried out for their weapons.
93. Then advanced Tiamat and Marduk, the counsellor of the gods;
94. To the fight they came on, to the battle they drew nigh.
95. The lord spread out his net and caught her,
96. And the evil wind that was behind (him) he let loose in her face.
97. As Tiamat opened her mouth to its full extent,
98. He drove in the evil wind, while as yet she had not shut her lips.
99. The terrible winds filled her belly,
100. And her courage was taken from her, and her mouth she opened wide.
101. He seized the spear and burst her belly,
102. He severed her inward parts, he pierced (her) heart.
103. He overcame her and cut off her life;
104. He cast down her body and stood upon it.
105. When he had slain Tiamat, the leader,
106. Her might was broken, her host was scattered.
107. And the gods her helpers, who marched by her side,
108. Trembled, and were afraid, and turned back.
109. They took to flight to save their lives;
110. But they were surrounded, so that they could not escape.
111. He took them captive, he broke their weapons;
112. In the net they were caught and in the snare they sat down.
113. The [...] ... of the world they filled with cries of grief.
114. They received punishment from him, they were held in bondage.
115. And on the eleven creatures which she had filled with the power of striking terror,
116. Upon the troop of devils, who marched at her [...],
117. He brought affliction, their strength [he ...];
118. Them and their opposition he trampled under his feet.
119. Moreover, Kingu, who had been exalted over them,
120. He conquered, and with the god Dug-ga he counted him.
121. He took from him the Tablets of Destiny that were not rightly his,
122. He sealed them with a seal and in his own breast he laid them.
123. Now after the hero Marduk had conquered and cast down his enemies,
124. And had made the arrogant foe even like ...,
125. And had fully established Anshar's triumph over the enemy,
126. And had attained the purpose of Nudimmud,
127. Over the captive gods he strengthened his durance,
128. And unto Tiamat, whom he had conquered, he returned.
129. And the lord stood upon Tiamat's hinder parts,
130. And with his merciless club he smashed her skull.
131. He cut through the channels of her blood,
132. And he made the North wind bear it away into secret places.
133. His fathers beheld, and they rejoiced and were glad;
134. Presents and gifts they brought unto him.
135. Then the lord rested, gazing upon her dead body,
136. While he divided the flesh of the ..., and devised a cunning plan.
137. He split her up like a flat fish into two halves;
138. One half of her he stablished as a covering for heaven.
139. He fixed a bolt, he stationed a watchman,
140. And bade them not to let her waters come forth.
141. He passed through the heavens, he surveyed the regions (thereof),
142. And over against the Deep he set the dwelling of Nudimmud.
143. And the lord measured the structure of the Deep,
144. And he founded E-shara, a mansion like unto it.
145. The mansion E-shara which he created as heaven,
146. He caused Anu, Bêl, and Ea in their districts to inhabit.
