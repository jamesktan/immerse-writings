9.1 Viveka Sutta: Seclusion
translated from the Pali by
Thanissaro Bhikkhu
© 1999

I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicket. Now at that time, as he had gone to spend the day [in the thicket], he was thinking unskillful thoughts, connected with the household life.

Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse:

"Desiring seclusion
you've entered the forest,
and yet your mind
goes running outside.
You, a person:
subdue your desire for people.
Then you'll be happy, 	free
		from passion.
Dispel discontent,
be mindful.
Let me remind you
of that which is good —
for the dust
of the regions below
	is hard to transcend.
Don't let the dust
of the sensual
pull
	you
		down.

	As a bird
spattered with dirt
sheds the adhering dust with a shake,
	so a monk
— energetic & mindful —
sheds the adhering dust."
The monk, chastened by the devata, came to his senses.


9.6 Anuruddha Sutta: Anuruddha
translated from the Pali by
Thanissaro Bhikkhu

I have heard that on one occasion Ven. Anuruddha was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicket. Now at that time, a devata from the retinue of the heaven of the Thirty-three named Jalini, one of Ven. Anuruddha's former consorts, went to him and, on arrival, addressed him with this verse:

Direct your mind
to where you used to live,
among the devas of the Thirty-three,
empowered
	with all sensual pleasures.
Honored, surrounded
	by deva maidens,
you
	will shine.

[Ven. Anuruddha:]
They've gone astray,
deva maidens
established in self-identity.
And they've gone astray,
those beings with deva maidens
	as their aim.

[Jalini:]
They don't know bliss
who haven't seen Nandana,
abode of the eminent devas,
	glorious,
of the Thirty-three.

[Ven. Anuruddha:]
You fool, don't you know
the arahants' maxim? —
'How inconstant are compounded things!
Their nature: 	to arise & pass away.
They disband 	as they are arising.
	Their total stilling is bliss.'

Jalini, there is now
in deva company
no further abode
[for me].
With the utter ending
of wandering on in birth,
there is now
no further becoming.


9.9 Vajjiputta Sutta: The Vajjian Princeling
translated from the Pali by
Thanissaro Bhikkhu
© 1998

On one occasion a certain monk, a Vajjian princeling, was dwelling near Vesali in a forest thicket. And on that occasion an all-night festival was being held in Vesali. The monk — lamenting as he heard the resounding din of wind music, string music, & gongs coming from Vesali, on that occasion recited this verse:

I live in the wilderness
	all alone
like a log cast away in the forest.
On a night like this,
	who could there be
	more miserable
			than me?
Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse:

As you live in the wilderness all alone
like a log cast away in the forest,
many are those who envy you,
	as hell-beings do,
	those headed for heaven.
The monk, chastened by the devata, came to his senses.


9.11 Ayoniso-manasikara Sutta: Inappropriate Attention
translated from the Pali by
Thanissaro Bhikkhu
© 1999

I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicket. Now at that time, he spent the day's abiding thinking evil, unskillful thoughts: i.e., thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, thoughts of doing harm.

Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse:

From inappropriate attention
you're being chewed by your thoughts.
Relinquishing what's inappropriate,
	contemplate
	appropriately.

Keeping your mind on the Teacher,
the Dhamma, the Sangha, your virtues,
	you will arrive at
	joy,
	rapture,
	pleasure
	without doubt.

Then,	saturated
	with joy,
you will put an end
to suffering & stress.
The monk, chastened by the devata, came to his senses.


9.14 Gandhatthena Sutta: The Thief of a Scent
translated from the Pali by
Thanissaro Bhikkhu
© 1999
Alternate translation: Olendzki

I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicket. Now at that time, after his meal, returning from his almsround, he went down to a lotus pond and sniffed a red lotus.

Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse:

You sniff this water-born flower
that hasn't been given to you.
This, dear sir, is a factor of stealing.
You             are a thief of a scent.

[The monk:]
I don't take, don't damage.
I sniff at the lotus
	from far away.
So why do you call me
a thief of a scent?

One who
	digs up the stalks,
	damages flowers,
one of such ruthless behavior:
	why don't you say it of him?

[The devata:]
A person ruthless & grasping,
smeared like a nursing diaper:
to him
I have nothing to say.
	           It's you
	to whom I should speak.

To a person unblemished,
constantly searching for purity,
a hair-tip's worth of evil
	seems as large
	as a cloud.

[The monk:]
Yes, yakkha, you understand me
and show me sympathy.
Warn me again, yakkha,
whenever again
you see something like this.

[The devata:]
I don't depend on you
for my living
nor am I
your hired hand.
	       You, monk,
you yourself should know
how to go to the good destination.
The monk, chastened by the devata, came to his senses.
