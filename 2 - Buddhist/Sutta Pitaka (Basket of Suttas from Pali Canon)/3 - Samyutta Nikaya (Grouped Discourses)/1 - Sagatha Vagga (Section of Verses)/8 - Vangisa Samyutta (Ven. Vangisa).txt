On one occasion Ven. Ananda was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Then early in the morning he put on his robes and, carrying his bowl & outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms with Ven. Vangisa as his attendant monk. Now at that time dissatisfaction (with the chaste life) had arisen in Ven. Vangisa. Lust invaded his mind. So he addressed Ven. Ananda with this verse:

With sensual lust 	I burn.
My mind 	is on fire.
Please, Gotama, 	from compassion,
		tell me how
		to put it out.

[Ven. Ananda:]
From distorted perception
		your mind is on fire.
Shun the theme 		of the beautiful
				accompanied by lust.
See mental fabrications 	as other,
				as stress,
				& not-self.

	Extinguish your great lust.
	Don't keep burning again & again.


Develop the mind
	— well-centered & one —
		in the foul,
		through the foul.
Have your mindfulness
	immersed in the body.
Be one who pursues
	disenchantment.
Develop the theme-less.
Cast out conceit.
Then, from breaking through
		conceit,
	you will go on your way
				at peace.
